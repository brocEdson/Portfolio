                <p>
                    I am Broc Edson. I program for video games. I am currently a student at Bradley
                    University, but I will be graduating in 2022. I have had a lifelong passion for
                    video games and the process of making them. Over the years I have been involved
                    in many game projects.

                <p>
                    My first professional team project, out on Steam! I worked on a lot of the AI
                    for this project, as well as some bugfixing near the end of development. For
                    my first professional project, I'm really happy with what I've done on it!

                <p>
                   This is my senior capstone project. Currently it is just a prototype, but I've 
                   already gotten a lot out of it about communicating on teams, taking feedback
                   constructively, and of course, many lessons about programming. I programmed
                   many of the hazards for this game.

                <p>
                   I have also released many other games by myself. Many of these are game jams,
                   where I learned a lot about programming with a quick turnaround. Others were
                   simple personal projects that helped me learn coding with Unity quickly.
